How is politics in non-democratic regimes different from politics in democratic regimes?  how we should define and measure the ostensible subject of this course, “dictatorship”? Dictatorship is a value-laden term; many people use it simply to mean \"political regimes or leaders I don't like,\" which is obviously not a very scientific way of using the term. Moreover, as we shall see this week, almost no country or leader is willing to call itself a \"dictatorship\" or a \"dictator\", regardless of its political culture. Should we then use this word at all? Is there a consistent, correct, and unbiased way of defining \"dictatorship\" and categorizing countries as dictatorships (or authoritarian regimes, non-democracies, etc.)? What are the consequences of categorizing dictatorships in one way rather than another? Does it matter what we call the political system of a country like North Korea, or of any other country?\n\nTo help us tackle these questions, you should take a look at chapters 1 and 2 of the first assigned reading for the week is chapter 1 of a book by Jennifer Gandhi, [Political Institutions Under Dictatorship](http://victoria.lconz.ac.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1174304), also available via Blackboard under \"readings.\" In this chapter, Gandhi discusses the history of the term dictatorship, and argues for defining it in a very “minimalist” way for the modern world. This allows Gandhi to identify which countries have been dictatorships in the postwar era, how many different kinds of dictatorship there are, and which rulers have been “dictators.” But her definition also means that many countries will \"count\" as dictatorships that may not seem very dictatorial to you, or may contain many apparently \"democratic\" features, and that many other countries will \"count\" as democracies that may not look very democratic to you. Consider: Is this a good way of defining dictatorship? Why does Gandhi think a “minimalist” definition of dictatorship is useful? For what purposes or questions would such a definition be useful? Is there a better way? \n\nTry making a list of a few countries you think are dictatorships today. Were Syria and Egypt dictatorships before the Arab uprisings of the last few years? Are Russia or Venezuela dictatorships? What about Cuba, or China, or Zimbabwe? As you may discover if you try to do this, one merit of Gandhi's approach is that it is *consistent*: her rules for deciding what countries are dictatorships are fairly simple, and allow her to produce a table classifying countries as dictatorships (of different kinds) or democracies (also of different kinds) going all the way back to 1945 ([available here](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S34558303Z3) and from the official DD page [here](https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/cheibub/www/DD_page.html)). I have visualized the resulting data in a [couple](http://youtu.be/zu_NsU0YoSAand) of very short [videos](http://youtu.be/ThbQD5I3kAg).\n\nTake a look at the videos if you wish, and consider: what can we say about the trends and geographic patterns in democracy and dictatorship? Are there any countries you can identify that seem wrongly described as dictatorships (or democracies) by this classification? Is the distribution of dictatorships and democracies what you expected?\n\nThe second reading, by Michael Coppedge et al. \"[Conceptualizing and Measuring Democracy: A New Approach](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711000880), also available under \"readings\" on Blackboard)\", takes a very different approach. Instead of trying to say that particular countries are or are not democracies or dictatorships, it suggests that there are many different models of democracy, and that our best bet is to provide many indicators of different dimensions of the idea when thinking about particular countries. They also discuss several of the problems involved in conceptualizing regime types and measuring them in the real world. Is this a better approach, or does it simply add needless complexity? When might we want a clear bright line between dictatorships and democracies, and when might we want a fine-grained view? (Remember, too, that in this course we are less concerned with what is a democracy than with what is a dictatorship, or an authoritarian regime, or a totalitarian regime, etc.; so we may not be always very interested in the nuances of democracy). \n\nWe will be using this reading to think about the problems involved in creating our own regime classification, which we will start discussing in the first tutorial (starting the second week of term). There are also other alternatives; if you have time and curiosity, you may wish to briefly look at Charles Tilly's book \"Democracy\", chapter 1, pp. 1-21 (Tilly was an eminent sociologist, but the book is very readable); the Freedom House [checklist questions](http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2013/checklist-questions) and [methodology](http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2013/methodology); and the [Polity IV user's manual, pp. 1-3](http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscr/p4manualv2012.pdf). Do any of these approaches to the problem f drawing lines in the political world sound convincing? Can we do better? Can we do without categorization?\n\nAgain, do let me know if you have any questions. Hope you enjoy the term,\n\nXavier",
