This is an exciting and challenging class, where we will have occasion to think about and analyse both current events and more general theories about authoritarianism and democracy. Events this year promise to provide plenty of material!\n\nTake a look around the Blackboard website -- check out the course outline, schedule of readings and lectures, and other info.\n\nTutorials will start the second week of term; sign ups open on Monday on S-Cubed. Though the tutorials are not strictly speaking required (we don't keep close track of attendance), they are STRONGLY recommended, since some of the assessment depends on your participation in tutorial. Sam Bigwood, Rose Morgan, and I will be your tutors.\n\nThis course has some relatively unusual assessment, and some aspects of it may at first seem confusing. Take some time to look over the [course outline](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ihn5wgv3eucbrx/POLS209-2015-T1.pdf?dl=0), as well as the detailed [schedule of lectures and readings](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rvqg4xqd99aao2z/Schedule_of_Lectures_and_List_of_Readings.pdf?dl=0), and come prepared with any questions you may have to the first lecture. \n\nA couple of points about the assessment are worth noting. \n\nFirst, a substantial part of your grade (40%) comes from your contributions to a \"regime classification exercise,\" which I will introduce in detail in the first class. This project will involve the entire class in designing, constructing, and evaluating a system for classifying political regimes with a view to answering a research question (e.g., are democracies better for the poor than authoritarian regimes? What kinds of dictatorships better protect human rights? Are some kinds of non-democratic regimes especially repressive? Does economic development happen faster under democracies or non-democracies?). In other words, we will be trying to create a dataset comparable to those produced by professional organizations like [Freedom House](http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2013), [Polity IV](http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/polity4.htm), or various academic researchers, and then using this dataset to make some judgments about whether there are important differences among political regimes in the modern world. Students have done amazing work with this project in previous years, producing data that is comparable in its reliability to the data produced by professional organizations, and Iâ€™m sure you can do even better this year; but it is a complex project with several intermediate deadlines, and it may seem confusing at fist. Fear not! Both your tutors and I will be providing exensive guidance throughout the term to help you do the best possible job with this assignment; my hope is that we can leverage the many and diverse talents of the large number of students in this class to create something we can be proud of. \n\nSecond, another part of the assessment takes place in the [course blog](http://politicalpathologies.blogspot.com), to which you will need to contribute something (not always a lot) every week or two, starting on the second week of the term. You may wish to [take a look at it](http://politicalpathologies.blogspot.com) ([here also](http://politicalpathologies2.blogspot.com)) and browse posts from previous students in the course to get some idea of what this entails. Some of your contributions will be very small and informal - comments, links, discussions of unclear points from lecture, questions, discussions of dictatorship-related ideas that may not have come up in lecture, etc. - but you are also required to submit two more formal \"explanatory blog posts\" (of about 1,000 words or so, though the exact word count is fairly flexible; each is worth 10% of your grade) on **dates that depend on the last digit of your student ID**. Let me repeat that: deadlines for these blog posts are **NOT** the same for everyone. \n\nA list of deadlines ordered by last name is [available here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qqv88nubda5m8sd/EBP_deadlines.html?dl=0); this list will be updated weekly to take into account late adds/drops. If the deadline you've been assigned does not suit you, I am happy for you to **exchange** deadlines with another student in the class, so long as **both** of you notify me of the trade and assure me that you are happy to switch places. \n\nIf you have any questions about anything, please do not hesitate to ask! You can always ask questions during the lecture or tutorials, come to my office, e-mail me (Xavier.marquez@vuw.ac.nz) or your tutors.\n\nSee you on Tuesday,\n\nXavier",
